Figuring out the basics

Hey!

I'm Kosta, I'm a highschool sophomore at Stuyvesant in NYC.
I'm really interested in math, computer science, and neuroscience.
I'm currently exploring AI, neuromorphic computing, and web development :).
On the side, I'm learning new languages, I just finished Javascript and ReactJS, onto Java!
I love music, art, and nature, whether that be hiking, camping, skiing, or something else, I love it all.
